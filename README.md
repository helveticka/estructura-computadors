# Estructura dels Computadors

## Content
Here, in this repository there are two directorys, where I store the final project of each part of the subject, I and II. 

### EC_I: SAL9000
The objective of this practical exercise is to write an emulator program for a given elementary machine.

- T0 and T1, which are used as interface with memory, in addition to being able to be used in some ALU-type operations as operands;

- X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, and X7, which are general-purpose and are primarily used in ALU-type operations, either as source operand or destination operand.

### EC_II: Minesweeper

For the second part of the subject, we've developed the game Minesweeper, implementing all of the I/O utilities on 68K available using traps and system functions.
